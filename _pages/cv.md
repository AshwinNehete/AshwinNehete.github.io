<!-- Education
======
* B.S. in GitHub, GitHub University, 2012
* M.S. in Jekyll, GitHub University, 2014
* Ph.D in Version Control Theory, GitHub University, 2018 (expected)
* M.S. (Research) in Mechanical Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, 2022 (expected)
* B.Tech. (Honors) in Manufacturing Sciences and Engineering, IIT Kharagpur, 2020 -->

<!-- Work experience
======
* Graduate Student Researcher - Computational Engineering and Robotics Lab (CERLAB), CMU
  * Conducting research for the “Depowdering & Metrology for Additive Mfg. Post Processing” project sponsored by NASA ULI.
  * Achieved scanned region visualization of an object rotating on a turntable as scanned by the robotic arm in gazebo.
  * Integrated linear stage actuator with ROS and arduino using MoveIt! and ROS Control.

* Undergraduate Student Researcher - Laser Material Processing Lab, IIT Kharagpur
  * Aimed at modelling the effects of various powder deposition strategies on warping that occur during the laser metal deposition process.
  * Proposed a 2D model which predicts the heat affected zone and residual stresses at the clad-substrate interface for the first clad layer.
  * The thesis titled, “Thermo-Mechanical Modelling of Multi-track Laser Cladding” was nominated for the Best BTP Award by the department.

* Summer Intern - CurtissWright (Williams Controls), Pune
  * Reduced the part rejection % by optimization of the automated inspection system for the job assembly using image processing techniques.
  * Studied the root cause analysis and the comprehensive documentation of a complaint regarding abnormal accelerator pedal behaviour.
  * Conducted lever break test, spring force test and worked on Coordinate Measuring Machine to inspect the dimensional accuracy of the job.

* Undergraduate Student Researcher - AGV Research Group, IIT Kharagpur
  * Studied design elements to conduct structural analysis and simulation of sensor mounts for Mahindra Rise Prize Challenge.
  * Designed CAD model on Solidworks and conducted structural analysis on ANSYS of Eklavya 6.0 chassis.
  * Significantly reduced the mechanical vibrations induced in the chassis during its driverless run, the major cause of failure of Eklavya 5.0 -->
